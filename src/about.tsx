                    This is a clock. However, unlike most clocks, this one can
                    show the time as not only the traditional hours, minutes and
                    seconds; but also as rotations, in both degrees and radians.
                </p>

                <h2>Why?</h2>

                <p>
                    It was a somewhat random idea I had during a maths lesson,
                    that I thought was interesting and so I decided to make it.
